<# Install-CheckMigrateDeviceFiles.ps1
. This script is intended to check if MigrateDeviceFiles is installed on a device.
If not, it will push the script onto the machine and set the PATH for the script
as well as set an alias.
#>

# Check if Script is on machine in the appropriate folder location C:\MigrateDevice

# If the Script is within MigrateDevice, proceed with setting this location as the PATH.

# Create an alias for the script so that you can run it with a command instead of having to find the directory and calling the script.

# Profit!!
