1)Ensure that Kubernetes is installed. For the purposes of this lab, i'll be installing it on my macbook, but can easily be installed on any device that can virtualize.
2)Create a mongodb username and password using base64 decode encryption. This will be stored in a Secret.yaml file that will be referenced later (could also be stored in the main mongodb yaml config file, but for the purpoes of visbility, we'll keep it separately here). 
--- < This line indicates a new document has started within yaml. Like a linebreak. Ex. Deployment and Service config files are usually in the same .yaml.
Once that yaml file is created (follow the template provided), run kubectl create .yaml to create the Secret.
3) Create the internal service so other internal ports can communciate with the internal mongodb.
